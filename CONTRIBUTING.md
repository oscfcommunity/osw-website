## Best Practices for Open Source Contribution

### General Guidelines

- Always create an issue before starting work on a new feature or bug fix. This ensures that the work is aligned with the project goals and avoids duplication of effort.
- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for commit messages. This helps maintain a clean and understandable commit history.
- Write clear and concise documentation for any new features or changes.
- Ensure your code is well-tested and includes unit tests where applicable.
- Respect the project's coding standards and style guides.
- Be responsive to feedback during the code review process.

### Branching and Merging

- Use descriptive branch names following the conventions outlined in the "Branch Naming Conventions" section.
- Before merging any branch, perform an interactive rebase to clean up the commit history:
  ```bash
  git rebase -i main
  ```
  This ensures a clean and meaningful commit history.
- Always update your branch with the latest changes from `main` before creating a pull request:
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout your-branch
  git rebase main
  ```

### Pull Requests

- Keep pull requests small and focused. Avoid bundling multiple unrelated changes in a single PR.
- Include a clear and detailed description of the changes in the pull request.
- Reference the issue(s) your pull request addresses.
- Ensure all tests pass and the build succeeds before submitting a pull request.
- Request reviews from relevant contributors or maintainers.

### Commit Message Guidelines

**Write clear, concise commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.**

**Format:**

```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New features (`feat(speakers): add speaker bio modal`)
- `fix`: Bug fixes (`fix(navigation): resolve mobile menu overlap`)
- `docs`: Documentation (`docs: update installation guide`)
- `style`: Code formatting (`style(components): fix indentation`)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring (`refactor(utils): simplify date helpers`)
- `perf`: Performance improvements (`perf(images): optimize loading`)
- `test`: Adding tests (`test(auth): add login validation tests`)
- `build`: Build system changes (`build: update webpack config`)
- `ci`: CI/CD changes (`ci: add automated testing`)
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (`chore: update dependencies`)

### Code Style

- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names.
- Add comments for complex logic.
- Follow existing code patterns and structure.
- Ensure all builds pass without warnings.
- Test responsive design on multiple devices.
